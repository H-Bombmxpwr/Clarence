This is a discord bot that does a whole assortment of different tasks. It is still a work in progress but as of 1/1/2022 it interacts with 12 apis, has a few moderation commands, has 
an assortment of local commands, has some games to play within the chat, and is able to play music within a voice channel. Use the $help command to see all commands, or $about to 
see a neater spread of the commands. The word.txt text file is full of over 1000 swear words from an online database, so if you are sensative to that I would recommend not opening it.
The profanity filter is all done locally and is done using a searhc tree algorythm that can be found in trie.py and implmented in the on_message of main.py.
